Entitlements - App Permissions
==============================

Entitlements tell macOS what your app is allowed to do.
This is part of Apple's security model (sandboxing).

For our app we need:
- Audio input (microphone recording)
- Network client (to talk to Python backend)

If you try to use a feature without the entitlement, it will fail silently
or show a permission error.

    App Sandbox
    Sandboxing restricts what the app can do for security.
    For development, we can disable it. For App Store, it's required.
